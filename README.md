As we move into an uncertain future, we hope to learn to live together in a resilient community. We aim to create affordable, sustainable, communal, safe, and accessible living, centered in collective decision-making and land stewardship. We envision a cluster of multiple dwellings with shared communal spaces and activities. We hope to use renewable resources and regenerative agriculture. 

We are temporarily using the name Equitable Community Housing. We hope a name will arise organically through conversations or based on the land we acquire. It’s important to us to find a name that isn’t inherently loaded so it can appeal to a broad range of people. 

Our financial and legal models are grounded in balancing the needs of current residents (financial accessibility, self-governance, low time commitment) with the long term stewardship of land and community. We prioritize a low buy in for new residents (< $500) and below market rates per month, over increased long term returns for residents. Any funds that would be raised in excess of expenses would either be invested back into the property or used to pay down debts.

We’re interested in Shared Equity Housing, particularly a hybrid model of a Community Land Trust  (CLT) + Housing Co-op using group equity (also called zero equity). A nonprofit CLT would acquire and hold the land, permanently taking it off the speculative housing market. The housing coop would lease the land long term and communally own the dwellings on the land. Group equity means that the initial funding would come from outside investors, ensuring long term affordability even after initial residents leave.
